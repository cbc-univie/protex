Spikes in Drude Temperature:

input simulation script is: sim_chelpg.py (d_coll was varied)

plotted with plot_drude_temp.py
-> distance argument in find_peaks can be used to identify all the peaks and get their position

also varied lambda states, plotted with: plot_drude_temp_steps.py (here d_coll was always 40/ps)

data to plot is in folder ./data
